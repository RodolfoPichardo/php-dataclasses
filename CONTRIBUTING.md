# Contributing

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to the PHP dataclasses project! 

The PHP dataclasses project is an open source project and it needs people like you to improve its codebase and to make it into a great library that more people can enjoy.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Create an issue before implementing new features, others may offer suggestions on the best implementation, and it leaves a trail as to why some decisions were made.
- Create tests for any bug or new feature. This project uses [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/) for its tests suite.
- Provide short examples for any new feature (see examples directory)
- Update the documentation, don't forget to document any exceptions that your new code may raise.
- Every PR should address a single issue, better to send multiple smaller PRs than a massive PR.

## Code of Conduct

Use common sense.
